- 👋 Sup, I'm EndowedCow!
- 👀 I’m currently working on a new app for making D&D characters, something that I think all other competitors are missing.
- I am also, as part of this, working on making XML easier for other users of the non coding variety.
- 🌱 I’m currently studying Cyber Security at University and learning software development on the side!
- 💞️ I’m looking to learn from others to develop myself further.
- 📫 You can message me on here or via Discord under the same name.
